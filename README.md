> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must login to *your* Instagram account in order to properly scrape someone else's Instagram account. This is due to Instagram blocking `HTTPS GET` requests from unauthenticated cookies. Your login information is never stored. See more [here](https://github.com/ibnaleem/instatracker/blob/main/main.py#L51C1-L56C136) and [here](https://github.com/instaloader/instaloader/blob/master/instaloader/instaloadercontext.py#L253C1-L338C43).

> [!TIP]
> You can always create/use an alt-account for the interative login.


## Installation
> [!TIP]
> [Install Python if you don't have it already](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Automated Logging
InstaTracker not only displays all modifications an Instagram account makes directly to the terminal (e.g., *USERNAME has unfollowed 1 person*), but it also records these changes in a text file, including the date and time.

This script checks for any changes every 5 minutes because Instagram's firewall starts blocking requests that are sent too quickly. You can manually update this [here](https://github.com/ibnaleem/instatracker/blob/main/main.py#L70), but do not be surprised if the script stops working.
